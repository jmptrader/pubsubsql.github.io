### [Download and install the distribution]

### [Test your installation]

### [Run command line client (CLI)]

### [Configure and run as a daemon (service)]

### [Run Interactive Query gui]

##### Download and install the distribution

PubSubSQL x86 64-bit distribution: [pubsubsql-v1.2.0-linux-x64.tar.gz]

PubSubSQL x86 32-bit distribution: [pubsubsql-v1.2.0-linux-x86.tar.gz]

Download one of the above archives and extract it into /usr/local, creating a PubSubSQL tree in /usr/local/pubsubsql . For example:

    $ sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf pubsubsql-v1.1.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz.gz 

To be able to run the server and the CLI from the command line without changing to the /usr/local/pubsubsql/bin directory, add /usr/local/pubsubsql/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can accomplish this by adding the following line to the end of your ~/.bashrc file:

    # add to the end of ~/.bashrc file
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/pubsubsql/bin

Run the following command for the changes to PATH to take effect:

    $ source ~/.bashrc

##### Test your installation

Run the server:

    $ pubsubsql
    info: 2014/02/13 20:36:31 listening for incoming connections on  :7777 
    info: 2014/02/13 20:36:31 started 

Quit the server by typing the letter q and press enter:

    q
    info: 2014/02/11 18:01:00 stopped

By default, the server listens for incoming connections on all available network interfaces and binds to the default port:7777. You may choose to specify a different port or host by using the -port and/or -ip options. For example:

    $ pubsubsql -port=1234 -ip=192.168.1
